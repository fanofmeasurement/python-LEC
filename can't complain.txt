Lookin' at the cop in the rear view mirror,
probably shoulda' stopped but the crosswalk was clear
I'll just imagine it's a ticket to a Broadway show.
Lookin' at the clouds and they seem kinda funny,
probably gonna rain but my outlook is sunny,
I'll just imagine that I'm layin' out in Mexico.
'Cause I know that pleasures gotta come with pain,
and I know that things won't always go my way
and I know life is gonna suck some days.
But I can't complain,
I can't complain
Every day's too short to let it go to waste.
And I can't complain,
I can't complain.
You gotta treat every day like a holiday.
And I'm tellin' you that I know some days I'm gonna stumble,
and I know the cookie's gonna crumble,
and I know life is gonna suck some days, but I can't complain.
Waitin' on a never ending train at the crossing,
payin' it no mind 'cause you just keep on talkin',
We'll just imagine it's the good old days and take it slow.
Spending Christmas eve on the floor at the airport,
dying to get back to the people that I care for,
smile and just dream about my puppy in my bed back home.
'Cause I know that pleasures gotta come with pain,
and I know that things won't always go my way
and I know life is gonna suck some days.
But I can't complain,
I can't complain
Every day's too short to let it go to waste.
And I can't complain,
I can't complain.
You gotta treat every day like a holiday.
And I'm tellin' you that I know some days I'm gonna stumble,
and I know the cookie's gonna crumble,
and I know life is gonna suck some days,
If you can't say nothin' good don't say nothin'
If you stop to think you could come up with somethin'
That makes you feel so good when time's are rough it's okay.
I can't complain (Oh oh oh oh oh x2)
Don't let it go to waste...
Now I can't complain (I can't complain)
I can't complain (I can't complain)

Every day's too short to let it go to waste.
Now I can't complain (I can't complain)
I can't complain (I can't complain)
You gotta treat every day like a holiday.
And I'm tellin' you that I know some days I'm gonna stumble,
and I know the cookie's gonna crumble,
and I know life is gonna suck some days,
but I can't complain.
